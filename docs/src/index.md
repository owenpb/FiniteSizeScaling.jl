# FiniteSizeScaling.jl

Documentation for [FiniteSizeScaling.jl](https://github.com/owenpb/FiniteSizeScaling.jl): a Julia package for finite-size scaling analysis. This package is for performing finite-size scaling to find optimized values of phase transition parameters (such as critical temperatures) and critical exponents, given data for finite-size lattices.

To get started, see the Examples page for a brief overview of the finite-size scaling method as applied to the Holstein model. Then see Demo 1 for a tutorial on using the package for optimizing one scaling parameter to obtain the best data collapse, and Demo 2 for an overview of how to optimize two scaling parameters.

For a detailed description of all available methods in this package, see the Methods page.
